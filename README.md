# Delypik
Delivery and Pickup Services

The primary objective of this study was to create a relational database for Delypik, an
organization that is creating a logistics application, which provides pickup and delivery services
to its users who can send packages to the specified locations and also get the required products
delivered with the buy and deliver option available from various stores across the city. This
database contains information that is required for this application. It also reduces Delypikâ€™s
efforts by 50% by avoiding the input time of huge amounts of data. Several analytics were
carried out across different platforms that shall help Delypik to study the performance of the
application and further optimize it.
As the Delypik application provides the pickup and delivery services, the database was modeled
by taking the required data field information that includes, the user information, employee
details, and delivery specific details. The EER and UML diagrams were modeled, followed by
the mapping of the conceptual model to a relational model with the required primary and foreign
keys.
The created database was implemented successfully in both MySQL and NoSQL environments.
To study the analytical capabilities of this application, the database was connected to R and
several visualizations were drawn.
